## AI Declaration
- Researching methods to store JWT tokens in the browser using the Gin framework.

- Understanding functions, for example setCookies() alongside the meaning of their parameers.

- Fixing errors in code, such as attaching ETags or tracking down invisible bugs (though sometimes AI suggestions weren’t much help).

- Creating a frontend design to follow, since styling isn’t my strong point.

- Writing the report clearly and documenting it, including declaring AI usage and other relevant notes.

- Researching routing, HTTP, APIs, logging errors in production, and comparing databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL.
